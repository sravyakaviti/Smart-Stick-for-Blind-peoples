# Smart-Stick-for-Blind-people
The smart blind stick automatically detects the obstacle in front of the person and give him a response to the person by vibrating the stick and also with a warning sound.

## Hardware Components
*Arduino NANO.
*Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04.
*LED pin.
*Buzzer.
*7805 Voltage Regulator.
*5V Power Supply.
*Connecting wires.

##Working Principle
Ultrasonic sensor is used for detecting the obstacles and the blind person can be aware by a buzzer sound.
Ultrasonic sensor sends high frequency pulses,these pulses reflects from object and takes as Echo,time between echo and trig is measured by Arduino.
