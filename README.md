# Smart-Stick-for-Blind-people
The smart blind stick automatically detects the obstacle in front of the person and give him a response to the person by vibrating the stick and also with a warning sound.

## Hardware Components
* Arduino NANO.<br>
* Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04.<br>
* LED pin.<br>
* Buzzer.<br>
* 7805 Voltage Regulator.<br>
* 5V Power Supply.<br>
* Connecting wires.<br>

## Working Principle
Ultrasonic sensor is used for detecting the obstacles and the blind person can be aware by a buzzer sound.<br>
Ultrasonic sensor sends high frequency pulses,these pulses reflects from object and takes as Echo,time between echo and trig is measured by Arduino.
