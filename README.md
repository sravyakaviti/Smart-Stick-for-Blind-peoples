# Smart-Stick-for-Blind-people
The smart blind stick automatically detects the obstacle in front of the person and give him a response to the person by vibrating the stick and also with a warning sound.

## Hardware Components
*Arduino NANO.<br>
*Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04.<br>
*LED pin.<br>
*Buzzer.<br>
*7805 Voltage Regulator.<br>
*5V Power Supply.<br>
*Connecting wires.<br>

##Working Principle
Ultrasonic sensor is used for detecting the obstacles and the blind person can be aware by a buzzer sound.<br>
Ultrasonic sensor sends high frequency pulses,these pulses reflects from object and takes as Echo,time between echo and trig is measured by Arduino.
